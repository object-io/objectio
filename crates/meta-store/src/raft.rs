//! Raft consensus configuration for the metadata service.
//!
//! This module declares the [`openraft`] type configuration that threads
//! through every consensus call: the command type, the response type, the
//! node identity, the log-entry wire format, and so on.
//!
//! ## One code path, cluster size is a deployment choice
//!
//! Meta always runs through Raft. A single-pod deployment boots a
//! single-voter cluster where there's no election drama and no network
//! RPCs; a 3+ pod deployment gets real quorum and leader election. The
//! code path through `Raft::client_write` is identical in both cases.
//!
//! ## Phase R1 scope
//!
//! Only [`MetaCommand::SetConfig`] and [`MetaCommand::DeleteConfig`] go
//! through consensus in the first phase. The rest of the 40+ mutation
//! handlers still write directly to redb and are not quorum-safe yet;
//! see the migration plan in `FEATURES.md` in the sibling `objectio-docs` repo.

/// 3. swap the direct-redb-write site to `raft.client_write(...)`.
